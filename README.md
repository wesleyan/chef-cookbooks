chef-cookbooks
==============

Repository for all Instructional Media Services cookbooks for use with OS X, Windows and Linux deployments.

The current scope of the cookbooks mostly span our OS X client deployments and roomtrol.

A lot of these are currently very Wesleyan-specific, but eventually we will work towards making them more universal for other institutional use.
