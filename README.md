Repository for all Wesleyan University Information Technology Services cookbooks.  Cookbooks are primarily for use with OS X, Windows and Linux deployments.

The current scope of the cookbooks mostly span our OS X client deployments and our cmdr endpoints.  Windows 8.1 client deployments are under heavy testing, so some Windows recipes are incomplete.

Pretty much all of these are currently very Wesleyan-specific, but eventually we will work towards making them more universal for other institutional use.
